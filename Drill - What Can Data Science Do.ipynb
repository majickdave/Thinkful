    "1. You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. In my opinion, there are two different paths to take. The first being centering the campaign around the highest conversion rate amongst the products. Essentially trying to further capitalize on the product that is selling well, regardless of the price comparison. The second being looking at the highest counts of activity (highest occurring queries) and pageviews, if different than the highest conversion rate, and attempting to push that campaign based on proven popularity.\n",

    "2. You work at a web design company that offers to build websites for clients. Signups have slowed, and you are tasked with finding out why. The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. One way to go about determining why signups have slowed is to dissect the onboarding process. Look at summary statistics related to the difference in timestamps between all 3 steps for the last 3 years, assuming they have completed all 3 steps. At a higher level, you could show a bar plot detailing the current onboarding step for all users in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You work at a hotel website and currently the website ranks search results by price. For simplicity's sake, let's say it's a website for one city with 100 hotels. You are tasked with proposing a better ranking system. You have session information, price information for the hotels, and whether each hotel is currently available.\n",
    "\n",
    "A.  One solution would be to rank the results first by availbility and then by price (ascending). Not related to this course, I would suggest functionality added to the website for viewing results by price in asending or descending order after availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You work at a social network, and the management is worried about churn (users stopping using the product). You are tasked with finding out if their churn is atypical. You have three years of data for users with an entry for every time they've logged in, including the timestamp and length of session.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. You could look to see if the difference in timestamps between logins is increasing. Further, if the difference in timestamps between logins is increasing and the session time is decreasing, that would be a case for churn. If you're finding that this is common for a large random sample of the user population, than churn would not be atypical.\n"
